        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am 18 years old. I am a very shy person, many confuse that with
            being "believed" however it is a word that does not really define me,
            I like to study. My biggest weakness in study topics is that I never
            ask because of nerves and it is something that should change, however
            I try to understand so as not to have inconsistencies with important topics.
            I really like pop music, I really like Video Games, lately I play a lot of
            valorant with my friends in my spare time and lastly I love spaghetti.</p>
